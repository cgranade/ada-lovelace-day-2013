Ada Lovelace Day 2013 Tutorials
===============================

These tutorials, formatted as IPython notebooks, introduce the reader to
some basic concepts in scientific programming using Python.
To view these notebooks on your own computer, install a Python distribution
that includes IPython ([Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/)
works well for this, as do most Linux distributions), and then run:

    $ ipython notebook
    
from the directory in which you downloaded the tutorials.

Alternatively, these notebooks can be viewed online, using the [IPython Notebook
Viewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
